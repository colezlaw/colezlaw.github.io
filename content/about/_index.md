I'm Will Stranathan, and I have a very small set of interests. Most of
the content you'll find on this site will be ramblings about football/soccer (usually [Charlotte FC](https://charlottefootballclub.com)), or
maybe software development.

I live in Charlotte with my amazing wife. I've helped launch two adult humans
to production, but they really did a lot of the work themselves.
