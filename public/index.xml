      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Will Stranathan, and I have a very small set of interests. Most of the content you&amp;rsquo;ll find on this site will be ramblings about football/soccer (usually Charlotte FC), or maybe software development.
I live in Charlotte with my amazing wife. I&amp;rsquo;ve helped launch two adult humans to production, but they really did a lot of the work themselves.</description>

      <description>In 2022, one of the local football club blogs was having a video podcast, and in the live comments somebody on a mobile phone said &amp;ldquo;Westwood should ahoy more&amp;rdquo; which I assume was &amp;ldquo;shoot&amp;rdquo;. But &amp;ldquo;ahoy&amp;rdquo; stuck as a word we yell when somebody shoots from outside the box now.</description>
